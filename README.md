Built on NextJS, alongside with Uploadthing for uploads of images and react-konva for the canvas and shapes.

## Initial Concept

This is intended to be bit of a photo editing app, in conjunction with the Spotify API to select a song (with its details such as title, artist, etc.) and have those details within a customizable selection of blobs (or what Instagram and other social media sites would call stickers) on a desired image to be shared with your friends and family.

## Things To-do

Include lyrics fetching (source is to be decided, Spotify API doesn't have endpoints to fetch lyrics unfortunately) for the blobs, because Spotify only gives you shades of color as a background when you share lyrics of a song.
